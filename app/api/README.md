# description
Include a specification of some kind describing the RESTful API. Specification of choice would be OpenApi 3.x. OpenApi 3.x provides extensive support for describing RESTful APIs. There are many tools and frameworks that support auto generating client packages.

# Notes and thoughts
The api.yaml is incomplete. I would review the api.yaml with the product team and the various stakeholders to ask any questions I might have about the different properties.

### Example questions for stakeholders
    - How long can a description be?
    - How should the sort work. What order can they sort the services on.
    - How exactly should the search capabilities work. Does the search only apply to the name property. Should we search within the description etc.
