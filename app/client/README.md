# Client
This module would be responsible for coming up with different packages that all follow similar patterns for interacting with the API being developed. I know there are many different tools to auto generate packages based on an agreed upon API specification/contract.

# Code Generation
I unfortunately don't have any of these tools setup in my VM for this project. If tools are not integrated into the development process I would recommend evaluating some different tools that provide this level of automatic SDK generation as it saves a lot of time for developers over time.
